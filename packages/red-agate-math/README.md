> Note
>
> To import this from your code, you need to use `babel` + `webpack` and import `red-agate-*/modules/*` paths.  
> (We have used the `import` statements for doing the [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).
> The `import` statements in the `.js` not the `.mjs` files cannot import from the vanilla node.js.)
>
> You can also import from the `.mjs` file on a node with the `--experimental-modules` option enabled.
